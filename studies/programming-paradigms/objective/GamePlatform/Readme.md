# Game Platform

## Modules
### Game Platform UI
ASP.NET Core MVC application that provides the user interface for the Game Platform.
It is a simple web application that uses bootstrap for styling html elements.

Additionaly it uses the following core libraries:
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore - for user management. It provides the user registration and login functionality.
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer - for database access. It provides the functionality to access the database.
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools - for database migrations. It provides the functionality to create and update the database schema.
- Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design - for scaffolding. I just hate to write boilerplate code.
