#### Loss Metrics
- Description: Model's error measurement
- Training vs Validation:
    ```python
    training_loss < validation_loss  # Healthy
    training_loss << validation_loss # Overfitting
    training_loss ≈ validation_loss  # Good generalization
    ```
- Good Signs:
  - Steady decrease over time
  - Small gap between train/val
  - Eventual plateau
- Warning Signs:
  - Validation loss increasing
  - Large train/val gap
  - Unstable values
#### Accuracy Metrics

- Description: Proportion of correct predictions
- Formula: correct_predictions / total_predictions
- Good Range:
  - Task dependent
  - Medical imaging typically > 0.9
- Warning Signs:
  - Stagnating early
  - Large train/val gap
  - Decreasing validation accuracy

#### Learning Rate

- Description: Step size for weight updates
- Typical Ranges:
  - Initial: 0.001 - 0.01
  - Final: 0.00001 - 0.0001
- Warning Signs:
  - Too large: unstable loss
  - Too small: slow progress
  - No adaptation over time

#### Precision

- Description: Accuracy of positive predictions
- Formula: true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)
- Good Range: > 0.9 for medical
- Warning Signs:
  - Low precision: many false alarms
  - Decreasing trend
  - Large train/val gap

#### Recall

- Description: Proportion of positives found
- Formula: true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)
- Good Range: > 0.9 for medical
- Warning Signs:
  - Low recall: missing cases
  - High precision, low recall: too conservative
  - Unstable values

#### F1 Score
- Description: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Formula: 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
- Good Range: > 0.9 for medical
- Warning Signs:
  - Large difference from both P/R
  - Unstable values
  - Decreasing trend

### Key Relationships to Monitor
- Loss-Accuracy Relationship
  - Loss should decrease as accuracy increases
  - Plateauing loss should match accuracy plateau
  - Sudden loss drops should reflect in accuracy

- Training-Validation Gaps
  - Healthy gaps:
    - Loss gap: < 10% of training loss
    - Accuracy gap: < 5% absolute
    - Precision/Recall gap: < 5% absolute
- Learning Rate Impact
  - Large LR: More volatile metrics
  - Small LR: Slower, steadier changes
  - Adaptive LR: Should match loss plateaus 
### Common Patterns
- Overfitting Signs:
  - Training metrics improving fast
  - Validation metrics → stagnating
  - Gap between train/val ↑ increasing
- Underfitting Signs:
  - Training metrics → (stagnating)
  - Validation metrics → (stagnating)
  - Both metrics low
- Healthy Training:
  - Both metrics ↑ (improving)
  - Small, stable gap
  - Eventual plateau
